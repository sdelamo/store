# Spring Boot Eclipse Store Sample Application

This application is aimed at showcasing the capabilities of the Eclipse Store Spring Boot extension. It demonstrates how to integrate a pre-configured storage into an application as a bean, how to utilize the locking API, and how to design an MVC application using Eclipse Store.

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command

```shell
mvn clean package
```

This will create an executable jar file **spring-boot3-simple.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

```shell
java -jar target/spring-boot3-simple.jar
```

To launch the test page, open your browser at the following URL

```shell
http://localhost:8080/  
```
